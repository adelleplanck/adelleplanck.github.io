                <h3>HOW MY WEB DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY BEGAN</h3>
                I originally started learning how to code for school by learning Python but later opted for Java instead. 
                For a while I focused on creating simple desktop and Android GUIs like Login and Settings panels. 
                While doing all of this, I also started looking into creating websites. I searched for a beginners HTML toutorial
                on YouTube and for the sole reason of me not giving up 5 minutes in is what got me here today.

                    <h3>WHY I CHOSE FRONT-END</h3>
                    I think anyone starting their web development career starts with the basic front-end principles. 
                    Basic HTML, CSS and perhaps a little JavaScript. I personally decided to stick to 
                    front-end because it enables me to visually express my creativity and skills more.
