             <h3>HOW I GOT INTO PROGRAMMING</h3>
                 I was always into science and forensic biology. Then I quickly realised that it was way too hard for me and 
                 lost all interest in the basic sciences. I then discovered <i>Computer Science</i> and learned <i>Python</i> purely for 
                 the purpose of doing my homework. When I noticed how fun programming was I decided to learn <i>Java</i>. I did an online 
              fundementals course and continued to experiment with different frameworks.

                <h3>MY WEB DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY</h3>
                    After a few months of programming I decided that this was what I wanted to persue as a career.
                    I did a bunch of research and came to the conclusion that it would benefit me to start learning how 
                    to make websites. With a lot of YouTube videos and help from <i>StackOverflow</i>,<i> GeeksforGeeks</i>  & <i>W3Schools</i>, I 
                    started experimenting with different features, techniques and frameworks. Eventually I started compiling some 
                    of my favourite projects into this portfolio so that I can showcase my skills and creativity.
