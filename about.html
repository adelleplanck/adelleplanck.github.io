                <h3>MY PROGRAMMING JOURNEY</h3>
                    As a little kid I was always into anything science, especially biology & chemistry, but when I started high school my interest almost completely
                    shifted to the IT and Computer Science field. I learned Python for a while and switched to Java because I wanted to make desktop applications.
                    I did a fundamentals course online and learned Swing & JavaFX afterwards.
                    <br><br>
                    On the side of doing Java, I stared learning basic HTML and CSS and played around with it a bit. Later I started incorporating some JavaScript into the websites.
                    I can work with the Three.js library for 3D objects and I'm currently busy with a React course.

                <h3>MY INTERESTS</h3>
                    I'm always busy learning something, like how things work or how to solve problems. Mathematics and Computer Science was and still is my favorite subjects. 
                    Anything tech will basically grab my attention. AI (Artificial Intelligence) and machine learning is cool. I'm fascinated by the creative ways people use technology to
                    help people in some way and my mission is to do the same.
